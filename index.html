<h2><b>Hi there !</b></h2>

<p>I am a <b>Scientific Collaborator</b> at the Federal Office of Meteorology and Climatology -
    <b>MeteoSwiss</b> in Payerne (Switzerland), since March 2020.<br>
<br>
Initially, I was in charge of setting up and executing the radiosonde data analysis for the WMO's
2022 <a target="_blank" href="https://library.wmo.int/idurl/4/68808">Upper-Air Instrument
Intercomparsion</a> field campaign. Since December 2023, I am a Peer Advisor for the UN's
<a target="_blank" href="https://un-soff.org/">Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF)</a>, working
with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Haiti. In 2025, I became the Measurement & Data focal point
for international capacity development projects at MeteoSwiss.<br>
<br>
I started my scientific career with a Master of Science in Physics at the Swiss Federal Institute of
Technology (EPFL), followed by a PhD in Astronomy and Astrophysics at the Australian National
University (ANU). Before joining MeteoSwiss, I was a Fellow of the European Southern Observatory (ESO) in Chile,
with <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eso.org/public/blog/next-generation-lasers/">duties at the
Unit Telescope 4 of the Very Large Telescope</a>. Back then, my scientific research was primarily dedicated to the
study of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1810/">young supernova remnants
using optical integral field spectroscopy</a>.<br>

<br>
The easiest way to get a better idea of what I do now and what did then is probably to take a look
at my <b>scientific publications on the SAO/NASA-ADS database</b>, using: <br>
<ul>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/q=orcid%3A0000-0002-9665-2788&sort=citation_count%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">my ORCID ID</a>, for an accurate list ordered by citation counts.</li>
<li> <a target="_blank" href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/search/fq=%7B!type%3Daqp%20v%3D%24fq_database%7D&fq_database=database%3A%20(astronomy%20OR%20physics)&q=pubdate%3A%5B2010-07%20TO%209999-12%5D%20%3Dauthor%3A(%22Vogt%2C%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%22%20OR%20%22Vogt%2C%20Frederic%22%20OR%20%22Vogt%2C%20Fr%C3%A9d%C3%A9ric%20P.A.%22%20OR%20%22Vogt%2C%20F.%20P.%20A%22%20OR%20%22Vogt%2C%20F.P.A%22)&sort=date%20desc%2C%20bibcode%20desc&p_=0">
my name</a>, to see my articles as soon as they make it to the arXiv (ordered by publication date). </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p> As one would expect, these pages will evolve as time permits ... </p>

<p><b> Cheers !</b></p>
