<p> Most of my research aims at improving our understanding of the evolution of galaxies in compact groups. Specifically, I am using optical integral field spectroscopy to map gas flows, abundance variations and star formation activity resulting from galaxy interactions in these dense environments. And try to better understand how large and small scales evolutionary effects connect.</p>
			
<br><h3><b>My research</b></h3>

<p> Most galaxies in the Universe have near-by companions. Some are located in clusters with 100+ members. Others are located in less numerous gatherings (5-15 galaxies) known as <i>Galaxy Groups</i>. It is well known that the environment is an important factor contributing to the process of galaxy evolution, e.g. with a larger number of slow-rotating elliptical galaxies found in the core of clusters. Over the recent years, it has been suggested that galaxy evolution might in fact start in group environments, before further processing inside galaxy clusters. This is usually refereed to as <i>pre-processing</i>.</p>

<p>I am using integral field spectroscopy to study the optical gas in star-forming galaxies inside compact groups. By measuring gas phase abundances, ionization parameters, rest-frame velocities and velocity dispersions (down to ~20 km/s) on scales <1 kpc over the entire optical disk of galaxies, I can build a detailed picture of the existing gas flows within the system, and characterize their relationship with existing star-formation activity. By tracking gas flows across the entire disks of galaxies, the idea really is to observe the mechanisms possibly associated with pre-processing on the scales of individual HII regions </p>

<p>WiFeS, the Wide Field Spectrograph, is an image slicer optical integral field unit with a spectral resolution up to R=7000 and a 25x38 square arcsec field of view, located on the ANU 2.3m telescope at Siding Spring Observatory (Northern New South Wales, Australia). This instrument has been the workhorse of my research during my time at the ANU with a total of 35 nights of observations awarded to my project. My instrumental use has been recently shifting towards MUSE on the VLT, which offers a larger 1x1 square arcmin field-of-view with 0.2x0.2 square arcsec spaxels, and a spectral resolution of R~3000 in the red. The emergence of Integral Field Spectrographs (like WiFeS and MUSE) over the recent years has opened a new way to study galaxies on a spatially resolved basis - namely, by acquiring a spectra for each pixel in the image. Maintaining the best possible spatial resolution possible throughout the entire data reduction and analysis procedure is a key feature of my research.</p>

<p>With a (seeing-limited) resolution of ~1-1.5 arcsec, WiFeS has allowed me to look in great details (at sub-kpc scales) inside individual galaxies. I have also using complimentary datasets (thanks to great collaborators !) such as HI radio maps to understand the large scale structure inside compact groups as a whole, identify where the cold gas reserves are located, and decipher the past and ongoing gravitational interactions. Altogether, the goal is to build a multi-wavelengths, multi-scale view of compact groups to understand the link between <i> environmental effects</i> and <i>localized/galaxy-wide consequences</i> within the group members.
